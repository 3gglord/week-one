- the process of getting started was interesting, and I find myself getting overwhelmed, especially because of all the new terms
- I would not consider myself bad with tech, but at this point, I feel a bit in over my head
- I forgot to screenshot the error message, but I made a mistake trying to open the Zotero app on my desktop because I tried to do it thorugh the installer rather then the application page. But the error message told me what I had to do to open the app, so I didn't have to google my mistake
- going slowly and reading error messages to fix a problem is working 
- I find that I have trouble asking for help, so if I encounter more problems I should actively try to ask for help on the Discord chat before giving up or digging myself a bigger hole
- failures I might have encountered this week...
