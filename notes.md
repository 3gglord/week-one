## Setting up Github
- relatively easy to create an account and make a repository by following the week one instructions
- did the Github introduction tutorial https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
- tutorial helpful to familiarize myself with terms and actions, helped to build confidence to try new things like creating a branch, merging, and deleting things
- option to create a website? haven't tried
- add a link with square brackets like this: [google](google.com)
- ! to add an image that has been uploaded to github
- **consult this [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for formatting**
- getting used to new terms will require continued use and practice 

## Setting up Hypothesis
- easy to set-up
- created annotations and joined the class reading group
- have not made any annotations on articles/webpages yet
- downloaded the Chrome extension
- could be useful for future classes to make notes directly on a reading

## Setting up Zotero
- relatively easy; no issues to download the application on my MacBook
- used the UCLA Library tutorial to get started
- downloaded the Chrome extension
- saved first two class readings onto Zotero using the Chrome extension with the application running
- will be very useful for keeping track of sources in the future, the auto-citation feature will be especially convenient

## Setting up Discord
- I have used discord before to chat with friends and play games, so I am familiar with the platform
- introduced myself to class
- continue to keep up with class discussion 
- way to reach out to peers and ask for help instead of waiting on emails
